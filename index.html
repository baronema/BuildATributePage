      <h4>Biography:</h4>
      <p>The man that would become known as "Magneto" was born Max Eisenhardt in Germany during the 1920's to a middle class Jewish family. During WWII, Max was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp where he was forced to stand witness to the murder of his family. </p>
      <p>Magneto's experience at Auschwitz shapes his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the world. Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutant-kind, he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants.
    He believes that mutants ("Homo superior") will become the dominant life form on the planet, however, he constantly wavers between wanting peaceful existence with Homo sapiens and wanting to enforce his superiority over all humanity. This has resulted in the story of a man who has been both, humanities only savior as well as greatest threat.</p>
      <h4>Magneto's greatest feats:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Magneto is the master of magnetism. He bends all metals and electromagnetic fields to his will. He is one of the worlds greatest minds as well as terrorists with power which can rock the very foundations of the planet. Magneto is the X-men's greatest and oldest foe, and for good reason.</li>
        <li>He defeated the immortal mutant, Apocolypse, in battle. Killing him with one large magnetic surge directed through the mutants body.</li>
        <li>Acted as founding member and leader of the Mutant Brotherhood. A separatist mutant group seeking equality for all, or at the very least a reversal of domination.</li>
        <li>Established an independent mutant nation on the island of Genosha. A place where all mutants would be treated equally and without discrimination. Magnus later goes on to lead the revenge rebellion after the island falls victim to mass genocide at the hand of killer centinal androids.</li>
